⚠️  TROUBLESHOOTING

Issue: Can't login
Solution: Ensure you're using numeric username (e.g., 1001, not admin)

Issue: CORS error
Solution: Backend and frontend are on different ports - this is normal
          CORS is already configured in settings.py

Issue: Media files not showing
Solution: Ensure media directories exist:
          mkdir -p backend/media/profiles backend/media/carousel backend/media/logo

Issue: Token expired
Solution: Frontend auto-refreshes tokens. Clear localStorage and login again if needed.
